These files are intended for the Propeller portion of the iDrivino.

Add the contents of /source/ to your Parallax Propeller IDE folder.
This is most likely ../Chameleon/cham_avr/source/

Open cham_default2_drv_112_gfxpalette.spin with the Propeller IDE.
Once opened, this file should take care of pulling the other spin files along for the ride.
